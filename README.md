hicplotlib
==========
A draft for a library to plot Hi-C interactions data. For now works well with whole-genome and by-chromosomal plotting and produces reasonably nice pictures. The good thing is that everything is based on matplotlib and all plotting options can be modified "externally", and all objects of a figure can be easily accessed. The comments/documentation for now are horrible.
